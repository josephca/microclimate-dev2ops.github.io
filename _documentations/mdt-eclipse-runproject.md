## Running a Microclimate project from Eclipse

Open your Microclimate project in a browser:

1. Right-click on your Microclimate server in the **Servers** view and select **Open Application**. Your application opens in the browser.
2. If the browser cannot handle the content of your application, change the browser to another one by navigating to **Window** > **Web Browser** and select from the list of available browsers. Repeat step 1 again.
