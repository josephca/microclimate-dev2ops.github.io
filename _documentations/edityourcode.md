## Editing your project

You can use your own editor to edit and test your code. For more information, see [Setting up your own IDE to use with Microclimate](settingownide). Or, you can use the Theia editor that is shipped with Microclimate by following these instructions.

You must first either [create](creatingaproject) or [import](importingaproject) a project. If you have created or imported a project, in the Microclimate header, click **Projects**, and then click the project name of the project you want to edit.

The project view appears. For more information, see [Managing projects](projectlist). Click the `Edit` button to edit your project.

If you're working in an IBM Cloud Private installation of Microclimate and see an empty page, the IBM Cloud Private session might have timed out. Refresh the webpage. If you are redirected to the IBM Cloud Private login page, enter your credentials again. When you log in, you can resume editing.
