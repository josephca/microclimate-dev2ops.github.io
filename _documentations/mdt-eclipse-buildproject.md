## Building a Microclimate project

By default, Microclimate detects when you make a change and starts a build automatically.  There are two exceptions to this:

1. If you have disabled auto build for the project in Microclimate
2. If you are using Windows

In these cases, start a build manually when you have made a change or a set of changes:

1. Right-click on your Microclimate server in the **Servers** view and select **Start Build**.
2. Wait for the server to return to **Started** or **Debugging** state in the **Servers** view and then test your changes.
