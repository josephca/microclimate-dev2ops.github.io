## Unlinking from a Microclimate project

To unlink an Eclipse project from a Microclimate project, delete the server from the **Servers** view. To do this, right-click on the Microclimate server in the **Servers** view and select **Delete**.

If your Microclimate server is currently in debug mode, it is restarted in run mode when the server is deleted.
